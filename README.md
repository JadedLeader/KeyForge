# KeyForge

## Project description 
<br> KeyForge is an API-first, microservices-based platform that provides secure, multi-tenant vaults for managing cryptographic keys and secrets. Built around a strict domain-driven architecture, KeyForge lets individuals and teams spin up isolated “vaults,” 
store and rotate keys with fine-grained policies, and collaborate safely via invitation workflows and real-time audit feeds. Every action—creating a vault, issuing a key, 
accessing a secret—is immutably logged and can be streamed live to dashboards for compliance and security monitoring.
